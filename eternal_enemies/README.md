# Free Donatella

## Description
This is a game to raise awareness about the threat that pollution represents for the planet. Donatella is a turtle that tries to survive in the ocean, surrounded by an increasing amount of rubbish that will put her life in danger. This is my first project of Ironhack Barcelona web development bootcamp (January 2020).
